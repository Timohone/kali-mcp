## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- Claude Desktop application
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3) or compatible system

### 1. Set Up Project
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir kali-tools-mcp-server
cd kali-tools-mcp-server

# Copy the following files to this directory:
# - Dockerfile
# - requirements.txt
# - server.py
```

### 2. Build Docker Image
```bash
# Build the image for Apple Silicon (includes web scraping, takes 3-5 minutes)
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t kali-tools-mcp-server .
```

### 3. Test the Build
```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 kali-tools-mcp-server python -c "
import sys; sys.path.append('/app')
from server import KaliToolsServer
server = KaliToolsServer()
print(f'‚úÖ Successfully loaded {len(server.tools_data)} Kali tools')
print(f'Categories: {list(server.categories.keys())}')
"
```

### 4. Configure Claude Desktop
Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

Location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kali-tools": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--platform",
        "linux/arm64",
        "kali-tools-mcp-server",
        "python",
        "/app/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop
Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server.

## Usage Examples
Once configured, interact with the Kali Tools database directly through Claude Desktop:
- **Search for Tools:** "What Kali tools are available for SQL injection testing?"
- **Get Tool Details:** "Get detailed information about sqlmap"
- **Browse by Category:** "List all web application testing tools"
- **Usage and Examples:** "Show me sqlmap usage examples"

## MCP Server Tools
The MCP server provides five main tools:
1. `search_kali_tools` ‚Äî Search the Kali tools database by name, description, or functionality
2. `get_tool_details` ‚Äî Get comprehensive information about a specific tool
3. `list_tools_by_category` ‚Äî List all tools in a specific security category
4. `get_tool_usage` ‚Äî Get usage examples and command syntax for a specific tool
5. `list_categories` ‚Äî Show all available tool categories with tool counts

## Project Structure
```
kali-tools-mcp-server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile              # Container with Kali tools GitLab repository
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies (MCP, PyYAML)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py               # Main MCP server with PackagesInfo parsing

```

## Architecture
- **Repository Cloning:** Clones official Kali tools documentation from GitLab during build
- **PackagesInfo Parsing:** Extracts tool descriptions from PackagesInfo sections in markdown files
- **Smart Categorization:** Automatically categorizes tools by functionality using keyword analysis
- **Content Extraction:** Parses YAML frontmatter, usage examples, and installation instructions
- **MCP Interface:** Provides search and query capabilities through MCP tools
- **On-Demand Execution:** Runs fresh containers for each Claude Desktop session

## Data Sources
- Official Kali Linux tools documentation from GitLab repository
- Individual tool directories containing index.md files
- PackagesInfo sections, YAML frontmatter, usage examples
- Intelligent categorization based on tool descriptions and functionality

## Key Parsing Features
- **PackagesInfo Detection:** Automatically finds and extracts content following "PackagesInfo:" sections
- **YAML Frontmatter:** Extracts title, homepage, repository, and other metadata
- **Content Cleaning:** Filters out Hugo shortcodes and HTML comments

## Troubleshooting
- **Build takes longer than expected:** The build includes cloning the full Kali tools GitLab repository
- **Limited tools loaded:** Check that the GitLab repository was cloned successfully
- **Description parsing issues:** Most tools should have meaningful descriptions from PackagesInfo sections
